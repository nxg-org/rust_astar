# Rust Pathfinding

We're messing around with pathfinding implementations (which will eventually be put into a 3D environment)

We're rather dumb right now, however, so don't expect anything working for the next few days.

### Checklist:
- Generic PathSolver layout (mostly done)
- AStar implementation (untested, but should work, might have memory leaks not sure yet)
- Proper implementation (world environment and what-not) [not done]
